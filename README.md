#### **What is a Roblox Gift Card?**

A **Roblox Gift Card** is a prepaid card that can be used to add credit to a Roblox account. The card typically comes in various denominations and can be redeemed online for Robux or a Roblox Premium membership.

A Roblox gift card is available in physical form (which you can buy in stores) or digital form (which you can purchase and redeem online).

When redeemed, the value of the gift card is converted into Robux, which can then be spent on a variety of items in the Roblox catalog or used to upgrade the user’s account to Roblox Premium, which provides several perks, such as a monthly Robux stipend, access to exclusive items, and the ability to trade limited items.
